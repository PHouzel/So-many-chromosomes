Deadlines:
- 28/10 : some result and general models
- ?/12 :

Planning:
Up to 28/10
- simulation at 100(N) 1000(N) 10000(Lo) 50000(Lo) 100000 10^6 ( Lo and N )
- approx 20 sim for each legnth in order to get an effective average via variance calculation (Lu & P)
- check therm time dep on length of chains (Lu & P or video)
- maybe check ergodicity with many fixed-param simulation 
- varying const
- pi greco theorem
