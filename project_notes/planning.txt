Deadlines:
- 28/10 : some result and general models
- ?/12 :

Planning:
Up to 28/10
- check execution structure, nest-directory system by N
- talking about the code: how to optimize? dumping periods? Terminal print? n steps, dumping etc
- utility code: multiple simulations, save as video, etc
- simulations at 100(N) 1000(Lo-UPLOADED) 10000(Lo-UPLOADED) 50000(Lo) ( Lo and N )
- approx 20 sim for each lenhth (Lo & N) in order to get an effective average via variance calculation (Lu & P)
- check therm time dep on length of chains (Lu & P or video)
- maybe check ergodicity with many fixed-param simulation 
- varying const
- pi greco theorem
