Deadlines:
- 28/10 : some result and general models
- ?/12 :

Planning:
Up to 28/10
TO PRESENT: model, videos (!!!), Pierre part, self-constraint 

TO DO:
- introduction(P): problem, assumptions, parameters, introduction
- (Lo) parameters variation effects for 2k long chains 
- check execution structure, nest-directory system by N
- talking about the code: how to optimize? dumping periods? Terminal print? n steps, dumping etc
- utility code: multiple simulations, save as video, etc
- approx 20 sim for each length (Lo & N) in order to get an effective average via variance calculation (Lu & P)
- check therm time dep on length of chains (Lu & P or video) 
- maybe check ergodicity with many fixed-param simulation 
- varying const
- pi greco theorem
- are BCs actually needed? Self confinment and self-interactions are sufficient to generate this behaviour? 



About case with fixed point on the membrane:
- initialize
- choose an extremal particle wrt 1 direction
- set its v = 0 (fixed molecule: https://sourceforge.net/p/lammps/mailman/lammps-users/thread/200702151219.12011.liujiwu%40msu.edu/#msg7171223)
- set potential
