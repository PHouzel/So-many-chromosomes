basis pair length = 3.4 A = 340 pm = 0.34 nm 
volume approx 0.02 nm^3

Persistance length of DNA about 150 bp i.e. 50 nm ([1])
Kuhn length = 2 * persistance length = 300 bp

Packing density (human): approx 1% 

Chromosome 4 : 180e6 bp, i.e. each chromatid 90e6 bp
Chromosome 3 yeast: 3e5 bp ([3])

For example a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) has persistence length lp = 50 nm
and Kuhn length b = 100 nm. ([4])

0.9 mu m in right graph --> 

TO DO (LORENZO):
- simulation with all walls A = 7 is meaningful to understand if anchoring is 
relevant only if we keep the correct packing density, otherwise is random. 
- Check how do box_side scale with the coarse graining 
- Also modify everything using Kuhn length i.e. 2*lp (mod boht chain and box)
- do not forgot to remove completely the bending potential


[5], about histons: The structure of the nucleosome core is relatively invariant from yeast to metazoans [1,2], 
and includes a 147 bp segment of DNA and two copies each of four core histone proteins. 
The core histones assemble into a spool-like structure onto which the core DNA is wrapped, 
in about 1Â¾ left-handed superhelical turns, forming a squat disc-like structure about 5.5 nm in height and 11 nm
in diameter [3] (Fig. 1A).
So one nucleosome is about 520 nm^3, containing approx 150 bp ( = 3 nm^3). That corresponds to 0.6% packing density,
half of the value given in the literature.
